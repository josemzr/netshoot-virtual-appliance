# Netshoot Virtual Appliance


This is a template to have the [Netshoot project](https://github.com/nicolaka/netshoot) by Nicolaka in an OVA format. It is very useful for those situations when you require a light and fast to deploy VM to troubleshoot a faulty network VM or container environment, but don't want to install a full VM.

The OVA is based around Debian GNU/Linux Bullseye and can be built using [Packer](https://www.packer.io). The Packer template is based around the Debian template developed by [Timo Sugliani](https://github.com/tsugliani/packer-vsphere-debian-appliances). 

The following Packer templates will build an OVA using a VMware vSphere ESXi host (although it is easily modifiable to build from VMware Workstation or Fusion) from a Debian Bullseye minimal image. After the creation, the VM will be customizable using OVF parameters, so network and root password will be assignable during deployment. If no network is configured during deployment, it will use DHCP.

**Requirements**

- A Linux or Mac environment (to be able to run the shell-local provisioner)
- A VMware ESXi host to use as builder prepared for Packer using [this guide](https://nickcharlton.net/posts/using-packer-esxi-6.html)
- A DHCP-enabled network.
- [Packer 1.6.6](https://www.packer.io/downloads)
- [OVFTool](https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/ovf/) installed and configured in your PATH.

**Building**

To build this template, you will need to edit the netshoot-builder.json file with your ESXi values:


```
{
  "builder_host": "packerbuild.sclab.local",
  "builder_host_username": "root",
  "builder_host_password": "VMware1!",
  "builder_host_datastore": "datastore1",
  "builder_host_portgroup": "VM Network"
}
```


Then run the build-netshoot.sh script or execute the following commands:

```
rm -rf output-netshoot/*

packer build \
    --var-file="netshoot-builder.json" \
    --var-file="netshoot-1.0.json" \
    netshoot.json
```

This project is possible because of the great work done in the [packer-vsphere-debian-appliances](https://github.com/tsugliani/packer-vsphere-debian-appliances) project and the amazing [Netshoot](https://github.com/nicolaka/netshoot) by Nicolaka. Also, Robert Guske contributed to the previous project, Netshoot-OVA.
